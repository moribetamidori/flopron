# PKM Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated the "Cuttie's Floppy Neurons" Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) system from Next.js to Electron framework.

## What Was Migrated

### Core Features

- **3D Memory Visualization**: Interactive 3D node visualization with rotation, zoom, and navigation
- **Tag-based Connections**: Automatic connections between memory nodes based on shared tags
- **Audio Feedback**: Sound effects for node interactions using Web Audio API
- **Interactive Canvas**: Mouse and touch interaction for 3D navigation
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Node browsing, filtering, and tag management
- **Modal Details**: Detailed view of selected memory nodes with images and links
- **Multiple View Modes**: Normal and preview visualization modes

### Migrated Components

- `PKMApp.tsx` - Main application component (from `page.tsx`)
- `CanvasRenderer.tsx` - 3D canvas rendering component
- `Sidebar.tsx` - Navigation and filtering sidebar
- `NodeDetailsModal.tsx` - Node detail modal component
- `UIOverlay.tsx` - UI controls and information overlay
- `NormalView.tsx` - Normal node rendering
- `PreviewView.tsx` - Preview node rendering

### Migrated Hooks

- `useMemoryTree.ts` - Memory node management and connections
- `useAudioContext.ts` - Web Audio API management
- `use3DRendering.ts` - 3D rotation, zoom, and projection
- `useCanvasInteraction.ts` - Mouse/touch interaction handling
- `useImageCache.ts` - Image loading and caching

### Data & Utilities

- `data.ts` - Memory log data structure and sample data
- `NodePreview.tsx` - Node preview component
- `timeUtils.ts` - Time formatting utilities

## Technical Changes

### Build System

- Added **esbuild** for fast React/TypeScript compilation
- Updated `package.json` scripts for React compilation
- Modified `tsconfig.json` to support React JSX

### Electron Configuration

- Updated main window size for PKM visualization (1400x900)
- Disabled sandbox mode for React compatibility
- Added proper window management and ready state handling
- Integrated Tailwind CSS via CDN for styling

### File Structure

```
src/
├── PKMApp.tsx              # Main PKM React component
├── data.ts                 # Memory data
├── NodePreview.tsx         # Node preview component
├── components/             # React components
├── hooks/                  # Custom React hooks
└── utils/                  # Utility functions
```

## How to Run

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This runs TypeScript compilation, React bundling, and Electron in watch mode.

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

## Features Preserved

- ✅ 3D node visualization with rotation and zoom
- ✅ Tag-based node connections with color coding
- ✅ Interactive sidebar with filtering
- ✅ Audio feedback on node interactions
- ✅ Image display and preview capabilities
- ✅ Responsive layout and dark theme
- ✅ Touch/mobile support
- ✅ Memory node search and navigation

## Next Steps

- Consider adding persistent data storage
- Add node creation/editing capabilities
- Implement data import/export functionality
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Consider performance optimizations for large datasets

The PKM system is now running natively as an Electron desktop application with all original functionality preserved!
